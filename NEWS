This minor release is mostly bug fixes and some small features.
I wanted to release a more stable and usable version before I start
hacking on a thread view rewrite.

* renamed config section [tag translate] to [tag-translate]
* docs: more elaborate API docs, INSTALL and USAGE as markdown in github wiki
* more compact header displays in thread view
* command-line history (for one session)
* editor file encoding is now user configurable
* signatures for outgoing mails per account
* optional display of message content in search results
* config option for strftime formating of timestamps
* printing

* fix parse multiline headers from edited tempfile
* fix reply to unusually formated mails (e.g. no recipient)
* fix lots of encoding issues
* handle extra wide characters in tag widgets
* fixes in ui.prompt
* fix storing outgoing mails to sent_box
* more liberal header encoding for outgoing mails
* use mimetype lib to guess right content-type of attachments
