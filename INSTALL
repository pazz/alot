INSTALL
=======

Alot depends on development versions of notmuch and urwid.
Note that due to restrictions on argparse and subprocess,
you need to run *python v>=2.7*.

1. urwid
--------
make sure you have urwid V>= 1.0

    git clone http://github.com/wardi/urwid
    cd urwid
    sudo python setup.py install

It seems you need the python headers for this.
On debian/ubuntu\:::
    aptitude install python2.7-dev

2. notmuch
----------
install notmuch *and* python bindings from git:

    git clone git://notmuchmail.org/git/notmuch
    cd notmuch
    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install
    cd bindings/python
    sudo python setup.py install

3. alot
-------
get alot and install it from git:

    git clone git://github.com/pazz/alot alot
    cd alot
    sudo python setup.py install

That's it, now `alot` should be in your path.

Alot tries to be as unobtrusive as possible, with one exception:
It forces you to use UTF-8 encoding whereever it can:
All text parts and headers of outgoing emails are converted to utf-8,
notmuch tagstrings, edited emails and config files are interpreted as utf-8.

All configs are optional, but if you want to send mails you need to
specify at least one account section in you config:

    [account uoe]
    realname = Your Name
    address = your@address

See USAGE for default keymaps and how to do fancy customization.
