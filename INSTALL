INSTALL
=======

Alot depends on development versions of notmuch and urwid.


1. make sure you have urwid V>= 1.0
-------------------------------------

> git clone http://github.com/wardi/urwid
> cd urwid
> sudo python setup.py install


2. install notmuch and python bindings from git:
------------------------------------------------

> git clone git://notmuchmail.org/git/notmuch
> cd notmuch
> ./configure
> make
> sudo make install
> cd bindings/python
> sudo python setup.py install


3. make sure you have argparse installed:
-----------------------------------------

If you are running debian and are still on python 2.6,
easy_install argparse


4. get alot and install it from git:
------------------------------------

> git clone git://github.com/pazz/alot alot
> cd alot
> sudo python setup.py install

That's it, now "alot" should be in your path.

Alot tries to be as unobtrusive as possible, with one exception:
It forces you to use UTF-8 encoding whereever it can:
All text parts and headers of outgoing emails are converted to utf-8,
notmuch tagstrings, edited emails and config files are interpreted as utf-8.

All configs are optional, but if you want to send mails you need to
specify at least one account section:

  [account uoe]
  realname = Your Name
  address = your@address
  sendmail_command = msmtp
  sent_mailbox = maildir:///home/you/mail/Sent

See USAGE for default keymaps and how to do fancy customization.
