Alot is a terminal-based mail user agent based on the [notmuch mail indexer][notmuch].
It is written in python using the [urwid][urwid] toolkit and features a modular and command prompt driven interface to provide a full MUA experience as an alternative to the Emacs mode shipped with notmuch.

Installation and Customization
------------------------------
Have a look at the [user manual][docs] for installation notes, advanced usage,
customization, hacking guides and [frequently asked questions][FAQ].
We also collect user-contributed hooks and hacks in a [wiki][wiki].

Most of the developers hang out in `#alot@freenode`, feel free to ask questions or make suggestions there.
You are welcome to open issues or pull-requests on the github page.


Basic Usage
-----------
The arrow keys, `page-up/down`, `j`, `k` and `Space` can be used to move the focus.
`Escape` cancels prompts and `Enter` selects. Hit `:` at any time and type in commands
to the prompt.

The interface shows one buffer at a time, you can use `Tab` and `Shift-Tab` to switch
between them, close the current buffer with `d` and list them all with `;`.

The buffer type or *mode* (displayed at the bottom left) determines which prompt commands
are available. Usage information on any command can be listed by typing `help YOURCOMMAND`
to the prompt; The key bindings for the current mode are listed upon pressing `?`.
See the [manual][docs] for more usage info.
