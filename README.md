Alot is a terminal interface for [notmuch mail][notmuch] written in 
python using the [urwid][urwid] toolkit.

The files `INSTALL.md` and `CUSTOMIZE.md` contain instructions on how to set it
up and customize respectively.

Autogenerated API docs for the current release can be found [here][api].
Their sources live in the `docs` directory.

Do comment on the code or file issues! I'm curious what you think of it.
You can talk to me in #notmuch@Freenode.
