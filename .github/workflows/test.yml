# WARNING: This workflow is deactivated until the gpg dependency problem from
# issue 1630 (see
# https://github.com/pazz/alot/issues/1630#issuecomment-1938174029 and
# onwards) is fixed.  The problem was introduced in c1137ea9: the gpg
# dependency is required with version > 1.10.0 and such a version is not
# currently available on PyPI but must be build from hand.
