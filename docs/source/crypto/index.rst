Cryptography (PGP/GPG)
**********************

alot aims to support GPG cryptography. Currently, only sending signed emails is
supported, but signature verification, encryption and decryption are planned.

To use GPG with alot, you need to have `gpg-agent` running. `gpg-agent` will
handle passphrase entry in a secure and configurable way, and it will cache
your passphrase for some amount of time so you donâ€™t have to enter it over and
over again.

In case you are using alot via SSH, we recommend to use `pinentry-curses`
instead of the default graphical pinentry. You can do that by setting up your
:file:`~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf` like this::

    pinentry-program /usr/bin/pinentry-curses


Signing outgoing emails
=======================

After composing a message and before sending it, use the `togglesign` command
(bound to the S key in the default config) to make alot sign your email.

By default, alot will leave the selection of a suitable GPG key to GPGME (the
GPG library we use), so you can influence that by setting the `default-key`
option in :file:`~/.gnupg/gpg.conf` accordingly.

In case you want to use a specific key to sign an email, you can pass that key
id to the `togglesign` command, for example `togglesign 4AC8EE1D`.
