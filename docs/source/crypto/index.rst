At the moment alot only supports signing of outgoing mails via PGP/MIME (:rfc:`3156`).
Encryption via PGP/MIME (:rfc:`3156`) is in an experimental stadium.

.. note:: To use GPG with alot, you need to have `gpg-agent` running.

  `gpg-agent` will handle passphrase entry in a secure and configurable way, and it will cache your passphrase for some
  amount of time so you donâ€™t have to enter it over and over again. For details on how to set this up we refer to
  `gnupg's manual <http://www.gnupg.org/documentation/manuals/gnupg/>`_.

.. rubric:: Signing outgoing emails

You can use the commands `sign`, `unsign` and `togglesign` in envelope mode
to determine if you want this mail signed and if so, which key to use.
To specify the key to use you can pass a hint string as argument to
the `sign` or `togglesign` command. This hint would typically
be a fingerprint or an email address associated (by gnupg) with a key.

Signing (and hence passwd entry) will be done at most once shortly before
a mail is sent.

In case no key is specified, alot will leave the selection of a suitable key to gnupg
so you can influence that by setting the `default-key` option in :file:`~/.gnupg/gpg.conf`
accordingly.

You can set the default to-sign bit and the key to use for each :ref:`account <config.accounts>`
individually using the options :ref:`sign_by_default <sign-by-default>` and :ref:`gpg_key <gpg-key>`.


.. rubric:: Tips

In case you are using alot via SSH, we recommend to use `pinentry-curses`
instead of the default graphical pinentry. You can do that by setting up your
:file:`~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf` like this::

    pinentry-program /usr/bin/pinentry-curses

.. rubric:: Encrypt outgoing emails

You can use the commands `encrypt` and `unencrypt` in envelope mode to
encrypt the mail. You have to give a hint string as argument to the `encrypt`
command. This hint would normally be a fingerprint of the key.

Encryption is done after signing (if signing is enabled) the email.
