Hooks
=====
Hooks are python callables that live in a module specified by `hooksfile` in
the config. Per default this points to :file:`~/.config/alot/hooks.py`.

Pre/Post Command Hooks
----------------------

For every :ref:`COMMAND <usage.commands>` in mode :ref:`MODE <modes>`, the
callables :func:`pre_MODE_COMMAND` and :func:`post_MODE_COMMAND` -- if defined
-- will be called before and after the command is applied respectively.  In
addition callables :func:`pre_global_COMMAND` and :func:`post_global_COMMAND`
can be used. They will be called if no specific hook function for a mode is
defined. The signature for the pre-`send` hook in envelope mode for example
looks like this:

.. py:function:: pre_envelope_send(ui=None, dbm=None, cmd=None)

    :param ui: the main user interface
    :type ui: :class:`alot.ui.UI`
    :param dbm: a database manager
    :type dbm: :class:`alot.db.manager.DBManager`
    :param cmd: the Command instance that is being called
    :type cmd: :class:`alot.commands.Command`

Consider this pre-hook for the exit command, that logs a personalized goodbye
message::

    import logging
    from alot.settings.const import settings
    def pre_global_exit(**kwargs):
        accounts = settings.get_accounts()
        if accounts:
            logging.info('goodbye, %s!' % accounts[0].realname)
        else:
            logging.info('goodbye!')

Other Hooks
-----------

Apart from command pre- and posthooks, the following hooks will be interpreted:

.. py:function:: reply_prefix(realname, address, timestamp[, ui= None, dbm=None])

    Is used to reformat the first indented line in a reply message.
    This defaults to 'Quoting %s (%s)\n' % (realname, timestamp)' unless this
    hook is defined

    :param realname: name or the original sender
    :type realname: str
    :param address: address of the sender
    :type address: str
    :param timestamp: value of the Date header of the replied message
    :type timestamp: :obj:`datetime.datetime`
    :rtype: string

.. py:function:: forward_prefix(realname, address, timestamp[, ui= None, dbm=None])

    Is used to reformat the first indented line in a inline forwarded message.
    This defaults to 'Forwarded message from %s (%s)\n' % (realname,
    timestamp)' if this hook is undefined

    :param realname: name or the original sender
    :type realname: str
    :param address: address of the sender
    :type address: str
    :param timestamp: value of the Date header of the replied message
    :type timestamp: :obj:`datetime.datetime`
    :rtype: string

.. _pre-edit-translate:

.. py:function:: pre_edit_translate(text[, ui= None, dbm=None])

    Used to manipulate a message's text *before* the editor is called.  The
    text might also contain some header lines, depending on the settings
    :ref:`edit_headers_whitelist <edit-headers-whitelist>` and
    :ref:`edit_header_blacklist <edit-headers-blacklist>`.

    :param text: text representation of mail as displayed in the interface and
                 as sent to the editor
    :type text: str
    :rtype: str

.. py:function:: post_edit_translate(text[, ui= None, dbm=None])

    used to manipulate a message's text *after* the editor is called, also see
    :ref:`pre_edit_translate <pre-edit-translate>`

    :param text: text representation of mail as displayed in the interface and
                 as sent to the editor
    :type text: str
    :rtype: str

.. py:function:: text_quote(message)

    used to transform a message into a quoted one

    :param message: message to be quoted
    :type message: str
    :rtype: str

.. py:function:: timestamp_format(timestamp)

    :type shell: bool
    :param spawn: should be spawned in new terminal/environment
    :type spawn: bool
    :param threads: should be called in new thread
    :type thread: bool
    :returns: triple of amended command list, shell and thread flags
    :rtype: list of str, bool, bool

.. py:function:: reply_subject(subject)
