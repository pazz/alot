The arrow keys, `page-up/down`, `j`, `k` and `Space` can be used to move the focus.
`Escape` cancels prompts and `Enter` selects. Hit `:` at any time and type in commands
to the prompt.

The interface shows one buffer at a time, you can use `Tab` and `Shift-Tab` to switch
between them, close the current buffer with `d` and list them all with `;`.

The buffer type or *mode* (displayed at the bottom left) determines which prompt commands
are available. Usage information on any command can be listed by typing `help YOURCOMMAND`
to the prompt. The keybindings for the current mode are listed upon pressing `?`.
