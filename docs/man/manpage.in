[DESCRIPTION]
A terminal-based interface for the notmuch mail system.
It features a modular and command prompt driven interface to provide a full MUA
experience as an alternative to the Emacs mode shipped with notmuch.

In all views, arrows, page-up/down, `j`,`k` and `Space` can be used to move the
focus.  `Escape` cancels prompts and `Enter` selects. Hit `:` at any time and type
in commands to the prompt. Usage information on any command can be listed by typing
`help YOURCOMMAND` to the prompt; The keybindings for the current mode are listet
upon pressing `?`.

[BUGS]
Alot is a fairly new project, so expect misbehaviour. Bugs can be reported via the
issue tracker on the projecs github page (https://github.com/pazz/alot).
